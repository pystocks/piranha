# Piranha

## Overview
Piranha is a cyber threat intelligence and hunt plan development platform that bridges the fap between intelligence requirements and actionable detection strategies. It connects APTs, MITRE ATT&CK techniques, CVEs, Nessus scans, and CTI reports into a unified platform that empowers analysts of all skill levels to:
 
 - Build an Analytic Scheme of Maneuver (ASOM) in minutes
 - Enirch data with AI
 - Map vulnerabilities to adversary behaviors
 - Visualize relevant techniques on a 3D heatmap
 - Optimize hunt plans based on operational requirements
 - Build custom threat profiles
 - Etc.

## Importing Data
A user has the ability to import a few different files:

- .nessus/.xml for Nessus vulnerability scans
- .json for Barracuda exports
- .pir for importing Piranha Profiles
